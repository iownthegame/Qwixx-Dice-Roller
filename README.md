# Qwixx-Dice-Roller

## Description

Implement an online dice roller for [Qwixx](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwixx) board game. Also allowed to remove the colored dice if the row is closed.

## Movitation

There was once during a long train trip my friends and I wanted to play Qwixx on the train, obviously it was not that convenient to throw the REAL dices. There are already many dice roller online, but none of them with good-looking for my personal preferences, and there is no one that can remove the dice. That's where this idea came from. `Gooi` is **throw** in English, I loved this word so much thus decided to put it on the button.

## Demo

When a dice is removed (by clicking on the dice), it goes to the trach can. By clicking again it goes back.
